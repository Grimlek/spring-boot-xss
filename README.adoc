= Goals

I'm trying to provide a somewhat meaningful example of https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_(Cross_Site_Scripting)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet#Why_Can.27t_I_Just_HTML_Entity_Encode_Untrusted_Data.3F[Why Can't I Just HTML Entity Encode Untrusted Data?].
I'd like the demo to work within a JSP (or other Java Based Templating Technology).
Concretely, I've currently come up with the following example:

[source,xml]
----
<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<script>
    <c:out value="alert(7)"/>
</script>
<p>
    <c:out value="alert(7)"/>
</p>
</body>
</html>
----

The example demonstrates how properly HTML encoding an untrusted value `alert(7)` will be fine in an HTML context, but unsafe in a `<script>`.
However, it is not very realistic because a user would likely place the untrusted value in quotes:

[source,xml]
----
<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<script>
    var v = '<c:out value="alert(7)"/>';
</script>
<p>
    <c:out value="alert(7)"/>
</p>
</body>
</html>
----

With the value in quotes, the difficulty with getting XSS is that c:out escapes `"`.
For example, the following:

[source,xml]
----
<script>
    var a = "<c:out value="\";alert(7)\\"/>";
</script>
----

becomes:


[source,html]
----
<script>
    var a = "&#034;;alert(7)\";
</script>
----

In summary:

* I'd like to demo https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_(Cross_Site_Scripting)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet#Why_Can.27t_I_Just_HTML_Entity_Encode_Untrusted_Data.3F[Why Can't I Just HTML Entity Encode Untrusted Data?].
* I'd like the demo to work within a JSP (or other Java Based Templating Technology) but within a more realistic context.
* I'm fine if the attack is simply popping up an alert.
* It does not need to be html vs script (it could be something like an HTML vs HTML attribute). So long as it is something a somewhat responsible user would do (i.e. I assume the user would put quotes on the attribute, put quotes around the value injected into the JavaScript `var v = '${htmlEncodedValue}'`, etc)

I've put together a sample application for playing around with creating the sample at https://github.com/rwinch/spring-boot-xss.
The README contains details on the sample.

= Running the Sample

To run the sample from the command line use:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew bootRun
----

You can also import as an existing project into Eclipse using:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew eclipse
----

File->Import->Existing Project into Workspace

Then you can run by right clicking on `SpringBootXssApplication.java` and selecting Run As->Java Application

= Project Structure

The value being injected can be controlled in `SpringBootXssApplication`.
I'm not doing this via URL parameters since many browsers protect against reflective XSS these days.

Below is a guide to manipulating the templates:

|===
| Technology | Template Location | URL

| JSP
| link:src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/jsp/jsp.jsp[src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/jsp/jsp.jsp]
| http://localhost:8080/

| Thymeleaf
| link:src/main/resources/templates/thymeleaf.html[src/main/resources/templates/thymeleaf.html]
| http://localhost:8080/thymeleaf

| Velocity
| link:src/main/resources/templates/velocity.vm[src/main/resources/templates/velocity.vm]
| http://localhost:8080/velocity
